            Thomas and his friends are preparing for Christmas. Thomas and
            Percy are the best of friends, they are "Holiday Friends".
            <br><br>
            Kian and Wolf, what gifts do you want <span class="redsanta">Santa</span> to bring you?
            Do you want Mindcraft, Thomas the Train, Legos, new clothes, a new brother or sister?
            <br><br>
            Thomas and Percy are loading up their trains with presents to bring
            to <span class="redsanta">Santa</span>. You can see <span class="redsanta">Santa</span> and his reindeer in one of the pictures.
            Once all the gifts are loaded into <span class="redsanta">Santa's</span> sleigh, Thomas and Percy will clear the snow off the train tracks.
            <br><br>
            Kian and Wolf, will you be leaving a treat out for <span class="redsanta">Santa</span>? I bet he likes milk and cookies.
            On Christmas day will you be getting up early to open your gifts? 
            Will you wake up your mom and dad to come to the Christmas tree to open gifts?
            <br><br>

            I have a question, where does the Elf On the Shelf go on Christmas day, does he jump into <span class="redsanta">Santa's</span> sleigh and rides home to the North Pole?
